## Running the project

You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then do the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Leg3ndary/tag-store.git

cd tag-store

npm install
npm run dev
```

Note this won't work unless you have a MongoDB database with all the tags inside, however I'll probably add fake datasets later so people can actually run the project locally.
